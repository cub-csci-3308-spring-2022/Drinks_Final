## Submission Guidelines
Once your team document is ready and in PDF form, upload it to this repo. Make sure to add, commit, and push your changes. You should run the following commands inside your local git directory. Make sure you copy your PDF into your submission directory.

In a terminal opened inside your repo:

```bash
mkdir submission # then, copy/move your PDF into the submission directory
git add submission
git commit -m "add team document"
git push
```
