## Project Description

For adults 21 & over who want to have mixed drinks in the comfort of their own home our project is a cocktail website to help users try new drinks. With username and password, users can Input what they have at home then the website gives recommendations on what to make. Many people want to make drinks they usually have at bars but they may not know how to make their cocktails at home. This will aid them by providing them suggestions on how to make them.
It displays a variety of ingredients used to mix drinks with. The user clicks the ingredients they have in order to receive different drinks they can make from those ingredients. The user will receive a variety of drinks from those ingredients displayed in small cards which include the ingredients of those drinks and the measurements for those ingredients. Not only that but if the user doesnâ€™t have a clue what they want to make, there is an option to receive a random cocktail to make with the ingredients required for it.
